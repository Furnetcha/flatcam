FLATCAM

A simple command-line tool to generate gcode from a dxf-file. The goal is to have a nice 2D CAM-script for using a CNC-routers to cut sheets like you would normally use a laser cutter. It will automatically infer what side of a path the tool should cut along and generate the appropriate offset paths. No configuration beyond the diameter of the bit should be necessary.

This software is in the public domain.

Status: 
  - imports most dxf files
  - really only supports straight lines
  - can make a reasonably effective milling-plan and generate gcode
  
Plans:
  - add full support for arcs and circles
  - detect loops and generate containment hierarchy to support tool-offset-inference
  - support automatic inference and generation of offset tool-paths
  - improve planner marginally
  - raise and lower tool properly between cuts
